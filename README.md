# Emojify-with-Deep-Learning
Emojis or avatars are ways to indicate nonverbal cues. These cues have become an essential part of online chatting, product review, brand emotion, and many more. It also lead to increasing data science research dedicated to emoji-driven storytelling.  With advancements in computer vision and deep learning, it is now possible to detect human emotions from images. In this deep learning project, we will classify human facial expressions to filter and map corresponding emojis or avatars.
